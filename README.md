INTRODUCTION TO HTML
Review
Congratulations on completing the first lesson of HTML! You are well on your way to becoming a skilled web developer.

Let’s review what you’ve learned so far:

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.
Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them.
HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.
Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing <body> tags.
Headings and sub-headings, <h1> to <h6> tags, are used to enlarge text.
<p>, <span> and <div> tags specify text or blocks.
The <em> and <strong> tags are used to emphasize text.
Line breaks are created with the <br> tag.
Ordered lists (<ol>) are numbered and unordered lists (<ul>) are bulleted.
Images (<img>) and videos (<video>) can be added by linking to an existing source.
In the next lesson, we’ll take the content that you’ve added to this website and transform it into an HTML document that’s ready to go on the web.

HTML Tags
You now know all of the basic elements and set-up you need to structure an HTML page and add different types of content. With the help of CSS, very soon you’ll be creating beautiful websites!

While some tags have a very specific purpose, such as image and video tags, most tags are used to describe the content that they surround, which helps us modify and style our content later. There are seemingly infinite numbers of tags to use (many more than we’ve taught). Knowing when to use each one is based on how you want to describe the content of your HTML. Descriptive, well-chosen tags are one key to high-quality web development. A full list of available HTML tags can be found in Mozilla documentation. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element

Let’s review what you’ve learned this lesson:
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration should always be the first line of code in your HTML files. This lets the browser know what version of HTML to expect.
The <html> element will contain all of your HTML code.
Information about the web page, like the title, belongs within the <head> of the page.
You can add a title to your web page by using the <title> element, inside of the head.
A webpage’s title appears in a browser’s tab.
Anchor tags (<a>) are used to link to internal pages, external pages or content on the same page.
You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using <a> tags and adding ids to the elements you wish to jump to.
Whitespace between HTML elements helps make code easier to read while not changing how elements appear in the browser.
Indentation also helps make code easier to read. It makes parent-child relationships visible.
Comments are written in HTML using the following syntax: <!-- comment -->.
Take some time to edit the workspace you created and observe how it changes!



HTML TABLES
Review
Great job! In this lesson, we learned how to create a table, add data to it, and section the table into smaller parts that make it easier to read.

Let’s review what we’ve learned so far:

The <table> element creates a table.
The <tr> element adds rows to a table.
To add data to a row, you can use the <td> element.
Table headings clarify the meaning of data. Headings are added with the <th> element.
Table data can span columns using the colspan attribute.
Table data can span rows using the rowspan attribute.
Tables can be split into three main sections: a head, a body, and a footer.
A table’s head is created with the <thead> element.
A table’s body is created with the <tbody> element.
A table’s footer is created with the <tfoot> element.
All the CSS properties you learned about in this course can be applied to tables and their data.
Congratulations on completing HTML Tables!


HTML FORMS
Review
Nice work interacting with the extremely common and useful <form> element!

In this lesson we went over:

The purpose of a <form> is to allow users to input information and send it.
The <form>‘s action attribute determines where the form’s information goes.
The <form>‘s method attribute determines how the information is sent and processed.
To add fields for users to input information we use the <input> element and set the type attribute to a field of our choosing:
Setting type to "text" creates a single row field for text input.
Setting type to "password" creates a single row field that censors text input.
Setting type to "number" creates a single row field for number input.
Setting type to "range" creates a slider to select from a range of numbers.
Setting type to "checkbox" creates a single checkbox which can be paired with other checkboxes.
Setting type to "radio" creates a radio button that can be paired with other radio buttons.
Setting type to "list" will pair the <input> with a <datalist> element if the id of both are the same.
Setting type to "submit" creates a submit button.
A <select> element is populated with <option> elements and renders a dropdown list selection.
A <datalist> element is populated with <option> elements and works with an <input> to search through choices.
A <textarea> element is a text input field that has a customizable area.
When a <form> is submitted, the name of the fields that accept input and the value of those fields are sent as name=value pairs.
Using the <form> element in conjunction with the other elements listed above allows us to create sites that take into consideration the wants and needs of our users. Take the opportunity to take what you’ve learned, and apply it!
